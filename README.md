# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 This project is meant to organize and present in both a written as well as visual form the basic parameters needed for probable success when kickstarting a play.
 
### Purpose
The Purpose of this Project is to further acquaint the student with how to sort data, use functions, and create formula with multiple conditions. 
It is also meant to reinforce the way that things must be typed specifially and to showcase the versatility of Excel and how you can group data.
I liked this project, I had not encountered countifs before and the way that you can use it is pretty impressive. I could have used a lot of this knowledge in the past.

## Analysis and Challenges
The worst part of this challenge was figuring out the exact syntax to run three variables in the countifs function. I had not used this before so it was a 
learning experience to get it working properly. The graphs included in the folder are the best resource based upon the data available. These graphs allow a solid
understanding of the average threshold of funding met by plays as well as what quarter of the year is best for launching them.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When analyzing the data from launch dates to determine whether or not success is likely the best time of the year is near the beginning of May historically. This makes 
sense as people have more liquid funds during this time as it reaches the end of tax return season and people spend that money on impulse based purchases like a Kickstarter.
The worst times to start a Kickstarter historically would be in the months heading to December from May and the probability of success begins trending up from January to May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When analyzing the data on Outcomes based on the stated goal funding of the Kickstarter is that there is a much higher rate of success for Goals between roughly 1-2600 and 35-40k.
Anything outside of these ranges shows a much lower rate of success. To capitalize on this goal ranges should be set within these ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 The two main conclusions to be drawn from this are that Launches around Tax Return time in May has a higher rate of success, and that launches decline sharply on success heading to Decemeber before 
 slowly rising once more. This is likely due to the Tax Return money recieved, and the fact that people begin saving money to spend on Christmas.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the information available on Goals the success rate is highly dependent on the stated goal. Goals of between roughly 1 and 2600 and 35 to 40k all have the highest rate of success so 
placing your goal within either of those ranges is the most likely to succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are several pieces of data I would like to have access to be able to further refine these results. Specifically I would like to have access to further information on success or failure,
such as name of the Author of the Play to see if there is a known Playwright to increase success rates, as well as the sub-genre of the play to see if people support different themes more often.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
From this Data we could create graphs analyzing years for success and failure to see if there is an ebb and flow of support, we can also compare the different parent categories of the information
to see which of them is most likely to succeed a circle graph would be wonderful for this and easy to read.
